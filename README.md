showdown.js markdown render for syntaxhighlighter to suit  its code block style


###Feature

+ modified showdown.js for markdown-code-rendering by [syntaxHighlighter](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/syntaxhighlighter)
+ because of my lacking in javascript, i didn't write a plugin for showdown.js

###Usage

+ Just follow the [showdown guide](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown).
But you should use my js file like this:
```html
<script src="js/showdown/compressed/showdown.syntaxhighter.js"></script>
```
+ Use syntaxHightliter for rendering.
```javascript
SyntaxHighlighter.all();
```

Enjoy it:)    

Thanks to this great markdown converter:)
